# TheSlider

This is a simple content slider built using SwiftUI with the help of TabView and its custom TabViewStyle. I decided not to use the default index display mode so I made my own.

# Installation

Clone this repo and run in Xcode.

# Details

The slider works by dragging the image on top and the rest of the content updates by updating the selectedIndex property which is bound in TabView. This also updates the custom index display which I called the SlideIndicatorView.

Another visual detail I added is the changing background photo with a blurry mask to change the feel of each slide.
